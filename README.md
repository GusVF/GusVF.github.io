#Creating a project of a todo list. 

#Using React Vite, typeScript, 
1- Has eslint special instalations and behaviors.  
2- Worked on eslintrc.json to understand some rules.

About the App. 

1- The content is a baseline for a setup where you can use localStorage 
as a 'mock API' to simulate a request. 

2- If you create an API yourself you can replace the localStorage 
functions with function that make real requests to the API. 

3- It will be necessary to refactor the localStorage to properly 
save the desired data considering you have a databse.
